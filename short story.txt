It was a early tuesday afternoon, and Rickey was out walking his dog ferdinand who was a Great dane.
Suddenly a rabbit came out from behind the tree and bolted, ferdinand saw this and gave chase dragging Rickey behind him.
Rickey tried his best to keep the leash in his hands but ferdinand was too strong for him. 
Rickey fell to the ground, ferdinand saw this and stopped his chase of the rabbit and went over to Rickey and started licking his face.
