It was a early tuesday afternoon, and Joey was out walking his dog brutus who was a Great dane.
Suddenly a rabbit came out from behind the tree and bolted, brutus saw this and gave chase dragging joey behind him.
Joey tried his best to keep the leash in his hands but brutus was too strong for him. 
Joey fell to the ground, brutus saw this and stopped his chase of the rabbit and went over to joey and started licking his face.
